# Phase 1 Development: Foundation - Complete ✅

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: Weeks 1-2
**Completed**: October 2025
**Total Code**: ~1,017 lines of Swift across 7 source files

---

## Overview

Phase 1 focused on building a solid foundation for Prism - a fully functional native macOS text editor with core features. All objectives were successfully met, resulting in a working application that can be built and run on macOS 13.0+.

## Development Summary

### Core Objectives Achieved

The primary goal of Phase 1 was to create a functional text editor with basic file operations, and this was accomplished with the following components:

1. **Application Lifecycle Management** - Complete app setup with AppKit
2. **Document Model** - Robust file I/O with metadata detection
3. **Text Editing Engine** - Custom NSTextView with performance optimizations
4. **User Interface** - Window management, menu system, and status bar
5. **File Operations** - New, Open, Save, Save As with proper dialogs

---

## Architecture Implementation

### MVC Pattern

The codebase follows a clean Model-View-Controller architecture:

**Model Layer**:
- `PrismDocument.swift` - Document model handling file I/O, encoding, metadata

**View Layer**:
- `PrismTextView.swift` - Custom NSTextView with performance optimizations
- `StatusBar.swift` - Live status bar showing document metadata
- `MainWindowController.swift` - Window and view coordination

**Controller Layer**:
- `AppDelegate.swift` - Application lifecycle and menu system
- `MainWindowController.swift` - Document and window coordination

## Features Implemented

### 1. Application Lifecycle (AppDelegate.swift)

**Implementation**: `Sources/Prism/App/AppDelegate.swift`

Features:
- Proper NSApplication setup with `.regular` activation policy
- Shows in macOS Dock with standard app behavior
- Complete menu bar system (App, File, Edit, View menus)
- Keyboard shortcuts for all common operations
- Window management and app activation

**Menu System**:
- **App Menu**: About, Preferences (placeholder), Hide, Quit
- **File Menu**: New (⌘N), Open (⌘O), Save (⌘S), Save As (⌘⇧S), Close (⌘W)
- **Edit Menu**: Undo (⌘Z), Redo (⌘⇧Z), Cut (⌘X), Copy (⌘C), Paste (⌘V), Select All (⌘A), Find (⌘F - placeholder)
- **View Menu**: Toggle Line Numbers (⌘L - placeholder), Toggle Word Wrap (⌘W)

### 2. Document Model (PrismDocument.swift)

**Implementation**: `Sources/Prism/Core/Document/PrismDocument.swift`

Features:
- File loading and saving with error handling
- Automatic encoding detection (UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII)
- Line ending detection (LF, CRLF, CR)
- Language detection from file extension (40+ languages supported)
- Document metadata tracking (file size, line count, modification state)
- Atomic file writes for data safety

**Supported Languages**:
Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Sass, Markdown, JSON, XML, YAML, Bash, Zsh, Fish, and more (40+ total)

**Line Ending Detection**:
- LF (`\n`) - Unix/macOS
- CRLF (`\r\n`) - Windows
- CR (`\r`) - Classic Mac

### 3. Text Engine (PrismTextView.swift)

**Implementation**: `Sources/Prism/Core/TextEngine/PrismTextView.swift`

Features:
- Custom NSTextView subclass with performance optimizations
- Disabled automatic text substitutions (quotes, dashes, spelling) for code editing
- Word wrap toggle functionality
- Current line highlighting (subtle background color)
- Large file optimizations (>10MB detection)
- Real-time cursor position tracking
- Text change notifications for status bar updates

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Automatic spell check disabled for large files
- Grammar checking disabled
- Container size optimization for no-wrap mode
- Virtual scrolling support via NSTextView

### 4. Window Management (MainWindowController.swift)

**Implementation**: `Sources/Prism/UI/Windows/MainWindowController.swift`

Features:
- Main window creation and lifecycle management
- Document coordination (New, Open, Save, Save As operations)
- Native macOS file panels (NSOpenPanel, NSSavePanel)
- Unsaved changes detection and warning dialogs
- Status bar integration and updates
- Split view layout (text view + status bar)
- Window delegate for close events

**File Operations**:
- **New**: Creates blank untitled document
- **Open**: Shows file picker, loads selected file with encoding detection
- **Save**: Saves to current file URL if available, otherwise shows Save panel
- **Save As**: Always shows Save panel to pick new location

**Unsaved Changes**:
- Warns user before closing window with unsaved changes
- Three-button dialog: Save, Don't Save, Cancel
- Prevents accidental data loss

### 5. Status Bar (StatusBar.swift)

**Implementation**: `Sources/Prism/UI/Components/StatusBar.swift`

Features:

**Updates**:
- Live updates when cursor moves
- Updates when text content changes
- Automatic refresh on file load

## Build System

### Swift Package Manager

**Configuration**: `Package.swift`

- Minimum platform: macOS 13.0
- Swift tools version: 5.9
- Executable target with resource bundle support
- No external dependencies (pure AppKit)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Debug build
swift build

# Release build
swift build -c release

# Run directly
swift run

# Create app bundle
./build-app.sh
```

### App Bundle Structure

The `build-app.sh` script creates a proper macOS app bundle:

```
Prism.app/
├── Contents/
│   ├── Info.plist              # Bundle metadata
│   ├── MacOS/
│   │   └── Prism              # Executable binary
│   └── Resources/
│       └── AppIcon.icns       # App icon
```

## Known Limitations

These are intentional limitations that will be addressed in later phases:

1. **No Syntax Highlighting** - Planned for Phase 2 with Tree-sitter
2. **No Line Numbers** - Planned for Phase 3
3. **No Find/Replace** - Planned for Phase 3
4. **No Tabs** - Single document only, tabs in Phase 3
5. **No Preferences UI** - Placeholder only, full UI in Phase 3
6. **No Themes** - Coming with syntax highlighting in Phase 2
7. **No Auto-Save** - Planned for Phase 3

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **AppKit vs SwiftUI**: AppKit was the right choice for text editing performance
2. **NSTextView**: Provides excellent foundation with minimal code
3. **Swift Package Manager**: Works well for macOS apps (no Xcode project needed)
4. **Encoding Detection**: Requires careful handling of edge cases
5. **Native Menus**: Follow macOS HIG for best user experience

### Development Process

1. **Start Simple**: Core functionality first, features later
2. **Test Early**: Test with real files throughout development
3. **Performance First**: Monitor performance from day one
4. **Document As You Go**: Easier than documenting after the fact
5. **Clean Architecture**: MVC pays off for maintainability

---

## Next Steps: Phase 2

### Planned Features

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Tree-sitter integration
2. **Theme System**: Multiple color schemes
3. **Language Support**: 50+ languages with Tree-sitter parsers
4. **Performance**: Incremental parsing for real-time highlighting

### Technical Preparation

- Add SwiftTreeSitter dependency
- Create LanguageRegistry for parser management
- Build SyntaxHighlighter component
- Design theme system architecture

- Comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready build system

**Foundation for Future**:
The architecture is extensible and ready for:
- Syntax highlighting (Phase 2)
- Advanced features like line numbers, find/replace, tabs (Phase 3)
